In the Research Skills module (MIC11107), the Component 2 assessment constitutes 60% of the overall grade. Students are tasked with creating a laboratory report based on data acquired during practical sessions. The assessment involves:

Summary (15 marks): A concise 250-word summary, avoiding technical language, covering background, aims, methods, key findings, and conclusions.

Raw Data Presentation (10 marks): Report own MIC and MBC assay data, plus two additional datasets from classmates. A clear table should include MIC and MBC values, mean E. coli CFU/ml counts, observations about control wells, and validity indications.

Results Analysis (25 marks): Analyze and present results in tables or figures, reporting MIC50, MIC100, MBC50, MBC100, MIC and MBC ranges, and assay sensitivity. Include a detailed legend.

Scientific Discussion (50 marks): Write a 400-word discussion on key results, interpretations, limitations, implications, and future considerations. Use APA7th format for references.

The assessment emphasizes clarity, correctness, and depth of scientific understanding, with specific criteria for grading, ranging from Fail to Distinction.
